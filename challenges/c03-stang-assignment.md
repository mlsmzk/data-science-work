*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, mu_00, E_45, mu_45, E_90, mu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 mu_00  E_45  mu_45  E_90 mu_90 alloy

    ## 5 0.064 10500 0.323 10400  0.331 10400 0.327 al_24st
    ## 6 0.064 10700 0.328 10500  0.328 10500 0.32  al_24st

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <- df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = c("E_00", "E_45","E_90","mu_00","mu_45","mu_90"),
  ) %>%
      filter(E != -1 & mu != -1) %>%
        mutate(angle = as.integer(angle))
  

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    mu

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
##
```

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - It seems like there isn’t one true value; rather, the data indicates
    a range of values that material properties can take on. This is also
    a dataset with only one alloy tested, so it would be impossible to
    generalize beyond this specific alloy.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - There was one kind of alloy tested, al_24st. A quick survey of the
    data indicates this.
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, and 90 degrees were tested.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - Thicknesses of 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081 were tested.
- Is poisson’s ratio (mu) independent of angle?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut_interval(angle, n=3), y = mu))
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The box plot illustrated above indicates that the medians of Poisson’s
  ratio fit into the IQR of the (30, 60\] interval containing the 45
  degree measurements. This says that the median of the whole dataset is
  somewhere in the IQR for 45 degrees. The eye test says that angles
  closer to 45 degrees increase Poisson’s ratio, but it would be
  difficult to examine that without more angles tested. The closeness of
  IQRs in general is a decent refutation to any correlation there may
  be.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - The graph does support the claim that elasticity is an intensive
    material property.
    - For .022, .032, and .064 thicknesses, the value of elasticity is
      relatively similar and there seems to be no trend.

    - For the graph to support this claim, we would expect to see
      thicknesses of many varieties have similar elasticities. This is
      precisely what we see among the former three thicknesses.
  - This evidence is not conclusive
    - If it was, then one would expect to see data of thickness .081
      measuring higher on the elasticity scale rather than all being at
      the bottom; but this could be attributed to an unknown
      relationship between Poisson’s ratio and elasticity where the data
      point with mu=0.310, thickness=.022 is some outlier.
